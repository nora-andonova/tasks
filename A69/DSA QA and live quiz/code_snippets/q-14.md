#### Question 14 - Easter Egg, enjoy :)

Which of the following is NOT a type of algorithmic complexity?

- a) O(n log n)

- b) O(2^n)

- c) O(n^n)

- d) O(n / 2)

<details>

- Answer: d) O(n / 2)

- Explanation: Algorithmic complexity is expressed in asymptotic notation (Big-O), where we omit constant factors. O(n / 2) simplifies to O(n), making it not a distinct complexity class.
