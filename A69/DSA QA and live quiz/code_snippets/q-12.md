#### Question 12

What is the time complexity of the following function?

```python
def mystery_function(n):
    x = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            x += 1
    return x

```

- Answer: Answer: O(n²)

- Explanation: The inner loop runs i times for each i from 0 to n-1, leading to a total of 0 + 1 + 2 + ... + (n-1) iterations, which sums to O(n²).
