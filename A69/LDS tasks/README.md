# Linear Data Structures

### 1. Description 

In this exercise, we are going to practice classic problems involving linear data structures. Try your best by following the guides, debugging your implementation, and if all else fails, consulting with the solutions. These tasks are common interview questions and you are **very likely to encounter them again**.

### 2. Project information 
- You are given unit tests to verify the correctness of your implementations.
- Write your code in the provided functions.
- Do not change the function names and signatures

### 3. Reverse Linked List
Finish the `reverse_list` function:
```py
def reverse_list(head):
    # your implementation:
```
The function takes the `head` of a singly-linked list and returns the head of its reversed counterpart:
```
head: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> None
returns: 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> None
```
